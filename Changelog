Fixed Ammo Count when switching weapons 
(Originally it was done in the UI Canvas but the issue was that when the current weapon is destroyed, the script in the Canvas cannot pick up the weapon script anymore. Hence the solution was to incoporate the ammo count in the weapon script itself and get reference from the Ammo Counter script in the UI Canvas which is a better workaround.)

Feedback

- Might consider adding health bar

Second stage abit meh
- graphics and one more enemy-
- Second stage is not as difficult
- And transition to third stage can be too overwhelming
- Increase bandit spawn boundary 
- Bandit - give new state (charge up after spawn and charge towards enemy then go become normal behaviour) 
- Add behaviour in case boss loses line of sight
